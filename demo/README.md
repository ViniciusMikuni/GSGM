# Running the graph diffusion model on a toy dataset

You can try a simple version of the code using:
```bash
python toy.py
```

This command should create a dataset conssiting of gaussian particles, train a diffusion model over the dataset, then running the sampling method to generate new observations. Plots are created and stored in the folder ```../plots```
